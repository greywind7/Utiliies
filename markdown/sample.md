## italics 
surround text with _ to make it _italic_ \
Apparently backslash \\ is needed to end a line

## Bold
surrounding it with ** makes it **bold**\
Of course _**both**_ can be done and **_order_** does not matter

## Headers 
Well, there are six! levels of headers\
To use it, start the sentence with #*n where n = header level
### You cant bold in headings but _italics are allowed_

## Links
### inline
You can make links with the syntax\
[text](link) \[text\]\(link\) \
You can edit the link text like you would normally\
### reference
Syntax
[text][link] 
[link-name]: link-address
Advantage is that if a link appears multiple times it can be edited just once!\

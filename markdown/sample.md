## italics 
surround text with _ to make it _italic_\
Apparently backslash \\ is needed to end a line

## Bold
surrounding it with ** makes it **bold**\
Of course _**both**_ can be done and **_order_** does not matter

## Headers 
Well, there are six! levels of headers\
To use it, start the sentence with #*n where n = header level
### You cant bold in headings but _italics are allowed_
